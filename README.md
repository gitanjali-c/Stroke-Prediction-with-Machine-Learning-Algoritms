# Stroke-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Algoritms

Most strokes are caused by an unforeseen obstruction of courses by both the brain and the heart. Early detection and proper management of possible warning signs of stroke may help to minimize further damage. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are applied to various parameters that are used as risk factors to build a model for the prediction of stroke.
